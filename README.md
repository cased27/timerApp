# TimerApp

This short & simple app was an exercise to practice newly learned JS features such as:
* JS Classes
* using the keyword `this`: what it means and how to find it's value
* timers & intervals
* JS Getters & Setters
* SVG in HTML, shapes, and how to manipulate them using radius, stroke-dasharray, stroke-dashoffset, etc
* the method `.toFix()` which will cut off a decimal at whatever value you enter into as the argument

Issues with the app include:
* once the 'play' button is selected, if a user accidently selected the play button again, the app stops working (i.e. the 'play' and 'pause' buttons no longer respond unless the page is refreshed)

This exercise was heavily focused on JS (and the necessary HTML associated with it). The CSS was a separate  file (provided by the course instructor) and was not the main focus of the project.
